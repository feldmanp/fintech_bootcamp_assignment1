# Case Study - Nexo.io

![Nexo logo](/nexo.jpeg)

## Overview and Origin

Nexo was founded in 2017 by Antoni Trenchev, Georgi Shulev, and Kosta Kantchev. The company is registered in London, England. At that time, Bitcoin, Etherum and other crypto coins were getting more recognition and price appreciation, but the main thing that was missing is real world use cases that will drive the adoption.
The company was founded to function as a bridge between the crypto world and the financial world. The mission is to solve inefficiencies in the lending markets by creating innovative, convenient and sustainable solutions by harnessing the potential behind the blockchain technology.

The company was funded by Arrington XRP Capital using the Initial Coin Offer (ICO) mechanism. They raised $52.5M in this round in March 2018.
They had another round of debt financing in April 2020 of unknown amount.

## Business Activities

Nexo started as an online platform for a cryptocurrency backed loans but as the company grew they expanded their support for other traditional banking domains like term deposits and recently a crypto baked credit card. According to their website, Nexo currently serves more than 4M users, it has more than $12B in assets under management (AUM) and more than $80B processed in the last 3 years.

Here is a breakdown of all the existing activities for individuals under the Nexo platform:
- Borrow - Use your crypto coins as collateral and borrow cash or stable coins at a very competitive rates with no credit checks
- Earn - You can deposit cash or crypto coins to earn high interest yields
- Crypto exchange - you can buy crypto with cash, and you can swap between different crypto coins
- Credit card - Spend money while using your crypto as collateral
- Boost - Boost your position by using leverage (for example: using BTC as collateral, borrow stable coin and buy more BTC)

Other than services for individuals, they also offer Nexo Prime which is providing institutional clients all the necessary tools to trade, borrow, lend, and securely store digital assets. Nexo Prime is similar to the services provided to individuals but it is targeting fewer large customers with a more personalised approach and better rates.

Lastly in March 2022 they announced Nexo Ventures. This is a 150M fund that backs the early-stage crypto projects building the Web3 and its decentralised infrastructure.
According to Crunchbase, so far Nexo invested in 19 companies such as: 1Inch, Decrypt and BlockFills.

The intended customers of Nexo are all individuals and institutions which are using or intend using financial services based on crypto assets. To size the market we can look at the Market cap of all the crypto markets which is $890B according to CoinMarketCap. This represents all the money currently invested in crypto and Nexo would like to move as much as they can to be under their management.
If we assume that the mainstream adoption of crypto assets will continue to grow then Nexo will be able to capture some of this market as well. According to Allied Market Research the commercial lending market is estimated to reach $30T by 2030 and while the opportunity is huge, it is unclear how fast will be the transition to crypto.

The crypto market is relatively young and with 5 years of existence, Nexo is in a good position compared to their competitors in terms of reputation.
Nexo managed to create a regulated, secure and insured solution. The crypto space is known to be high risk with big projects like Terra, Iron Finance and more failing almost on a weekly basis. This is creating a great opportunity for Nexo and attracts individuals and institutions with lower risk appetite.
In addition, Nexo is providing very competitive rates. Their rates are defined by the loyalty level, the loyalty level is defined by how much Nexo tokens an account holds. The more Nexo tokens the better rates you get. For example, if you have a platinum loyalty level and you borrow with a low loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, you could have 0% interest, or you can earn up to 12% on your stable coins or cash.
Another advantage is the variety of assets they support, currently there are more than 40 assets and they are constantly expanding their offering.
Lastly, Nexo is able to provide an easy to use platform that hides all the blockchain complexities from a retail investor and provides a similar experience to digital banking.

By looking on Nexo's hiring board we can clearly see the need for blockchain developers. Since Nexo supports many blockchains like Bicoin, Ethereum, Solana and more, they built a layer on top that abstracts the differences and provides a seamless experience for the users. 

According to The Currency Analytics Website, a critical component in the platform is the Nexo Oracle that sits at the crux of the Nexo ecosystem and empowers the platform to perform its designated functions. The oracle helps to develop the loan contracts and automatically handles all the principal functions, including- disbursement of cash, maintenance of assets, timely provision of notifications as well as overall loan management. 
Then, another major function of the Nexo oracle is aggregation of real-time data which is fed to the Nexo ecosystem for its reliable operation. The oracle sources information from various exchanges to ensure credible real-time valuation of assets- a major step while offering loans to crypto investors. Nexo oracle is a decentralised oracle and hence assures real-time data aggregation from 6 independent sources that facilitates establishment of data authenticity for both the Nexo platform and its users.

Other than that, Nexo's hiring board is also showing that Java, PHP and Node JS are used as backend technologies and React is used to power the Web UI and the mobile apps.

## Landscape

Nexo is part of the Blockchain and Crypto industry. Within this industry Nexo is part of the financial services sector. This sector can be divided into two main categories:
- Centralised Finance (CeFi) - All crypto trade orders are handled through a central exchange. Funds are managed by a specific entity running the central exchange. This is the sector of Nexo
- Decentralised Finance (DeFi) - No exchange is involved in the decentralised exchange. The complete process operates via automated applications that are developed on top of blockchain platforms.

CeFi started not long after Bitcoin was invented with central exchanges like Bitfinex and Coinbase. As the industry evolved, the true nature of decentralisation was introduced with DeFi in 2015 when Maker DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) was introduced on top of the Ethereum blockchain.
Since then there has been rapid innovation mainly in the DeFi space. In 2021 the concept of DeFi 2.0 was introduced and it created new financial use cases like liquidity pools, yield farming, self repaying loans and more.
CeFi players are usually lagging behind the DeFi innovation, and eventually they tend to offer similar services with less attractive rates, but because of the better security, ease of use and legal compliance they tend to attract more individuals and institutions to use their products.
Since Crypto was invented, we see a constant growth in the industry and money moving from the traditional financial institutions to CeFi and DeFi. Currently the market cap of the DeFi market according to DefiLama is 70B while CeFi market cap is approximately 324B according to Akash Takyar the CEO of LeewayHertz

If we take a deeper look at the CeFi industry and specifically the lending market, Nexo has the following main competitors:
- Celsius - According to their website, Celsius network is a regulated, SEC compliant, lending platform that enables users to receive interest on deposited cryptocurrencies or take out crypto collateralized loans. 
Similar to Nexo, Celsius have their own native token Cel, and like with Nexo, the holding of the token will improve the rates and rewards. Recently Celcious was in the news after facing severe liquidity issues and freezing all withdrawals from the platform
- BlockFi - According to their website, BlockFi is for the intermediate to the advanced crypto trader looking for a one-stop shop for their cryptocurrency needs. It not only offers the ability to buy, sell, and trade crypto, but it also offers several products like earn and borrow with your crypto assets.

Other competitors worth mentioning are Crypto.com, Ledn and the big exchanges like Binance, FTX and Coinbase which offer earn and borrow products as part of their portfolio.

## Results

Companies like Nexo, Celsius and BlockFi are private so it is hard to objectively examine their business results. If we look at other CeFi companies, we can find Coinbase which is a publicly traded cryptocurrencies exchange but Coinbase revenue model is significantly different from Nexo mainly benefiting from trading fees.
Unlike Coinbase, Nexo does not charge any trading fees and according to the analysis of Coin Central website, the way that Nexo earns money is by the differential between crypto loans and deposits. These numbers are not public but there are other metrics that can serve as a proxy for these revenues. These are the number of users and assets under management (AUM):
- Nexo claims they have more than 4M users and more than $12B in AUM
- Celcius claims they have 1.7M users and $11.7B in AUM
- BlockFi claims the have 225K users and $15B in AUM

In addition to that there is the element of risk management, the money used as collateral for loans is usually invested in other crypto assets to produce additional yield for these companies. It helps them to offer more competitive rates and attract more users to their platform.
Nexo showed resilience during Crypto bear markets which indicates good risk management.
As mentioned above, Celsius is now facing liquidity issues because of poor risk management, Nexo used the opportunity, and offered to acquire Celsius. While it could be just a marketing trick to increase the confidence of consumers in Nexo it still shows superior risk management capabilities Nexo has over their competitors.

## Recommendations

I would like to see Nexo playing a bigger role in bringing the benefits of DeFi into the CeFi world. Here are a couple of ideas I have for this theme:
1. P2P Loan marketplace - Nexo could act as a facilitator in a loan marketplace where they connect borrowers and lenders and earn a facilitation fee. Such a marketplace would attract DeFi players who are looking for a more secure way to have a peer-to-peer solution with market driven demand and rates. Furthermore, this solution can be extended to a secondary market where users can buy and sell existing loans.
In order to provide such a solution, Nexo will need to expand their web application with a marketplace component. Similar marketplaces exist in the traditional financial sector like Plenti, MoneyPlace and more. As a backend solution Nexo could use the blockchain to log all the loan transactions and provide full transparency and history on lenders and borrowers for increased trust and compliance with regulations.
If successful, Nexo could create an API for other players in the crypto lending space. They can list their loans on Nexo's marketplace and share their revenues with Nexo (similar to Apple's app store revenue model). This solution will increase the number of users on the platform, the AUM and the revenues
2. Self repaying loans - This is another concept taken from the DeFi world. Many crypto tokens can be staked to earn yield. Since Crypto tokens are deposited as collateral for loans, they can be staked and the generated yield would be used to cover the loan principal. A side effect of that would be an increase in the collateral percentage and lower risk of liquidation. To provide such a solution, Nexo would need to develop smart contracts that can automatically stake the collateral, harvest the yield and cover the loan. In addition Nexo would need to maintain validator nodes for staking on different chains. Every network would have different technical requirements for that
It is possible that Nexo is already staking the collateral and harvesting the yields for additional revenue, but I believe that targeting the yield toward reducing the loan principal would attract more users and more capital. Therefore, I believe it is a better growth engine for the long term although it might have an impact on short term revenues.
